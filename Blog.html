                <h2>Learn Java   </h2>
                <p>ava is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

                <p>
                  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

                  Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]
                  
                  Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]
                  
                  Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[38][39]

                <h2>Learn CPP   </h2>
                <p>
                  C++  is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup and first released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[13]

                  . NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications. With . NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.
